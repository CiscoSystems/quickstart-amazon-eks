# quickstart-amazon-eks

## This solution has been superseded by Amazon EKS Blueprints. After March 21, 2023, only security concerns will be addressed. Existing deployments will continue to run. You may still deploy Amazon EKS through AWS CloudFormation, but no new features will be considered and the code will be modified only to address critical security events. We recommend that you migrate EKS workloads to either Amazon EKS Blueprints for CDK or Amazon EKS Blueprints for Terraform.

For architectural details, step-by-step instructions, and customization options, see the [deployment guide](https://fwd.aws/EP9QP).
